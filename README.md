# Primality Testing
Sorry for not creating a customizable path or just a path straight to working directory or something, but both Maple and Python was complaining when I tried that.

And please do reconsider running the scripts in full length as one would have to be very patient to do that.

And if it is not clear from the project:
- mr = Miller-Rabin
- td = trial division 
- aks = AKS
